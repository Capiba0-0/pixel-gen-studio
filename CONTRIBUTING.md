## 🎯 Contribution Guidelines
- Follow the project's coding style (C++20, `camelCase` for variables and functions and `PascalCase` for types).
- Keep changes **modular and focused**.
- Add comments to non-obvious logic or math-heavy parts.
- For UI elements or visual nodes, include screenshots if applicable.

---

## 🧪 Testing & Stability

- If your feature affects core functionality, make sure it doesn't break existing parts.
- Manual testing is currently sufficient (automated tests are planned for future versions).
